= Neo4j Graph Algorithms Jupyter Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks for each of the https://neo4j-contrib.github.io/neo4j-graph-algorithms/[Neo4j graph algorithms^].

== Setup

Create a virtual environment and install some required libraries.

```
virtualenv a
. a/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We're now ready to launch the Jupyter server.

The notebooks assume that there's a Neo4j server running at `localhost:7687` with username `neo4j` and password `neo`.
You can override these values with environment variables.


```
NEO4J_HOST="bolt://localhost:7687" NEO4J_USER="neo4j" NEO4J_PASSWORD="neo" jupyter notebook
```
